The project focused on the modeling and stabilization of a class of linear port-Hamiltonian systems, particularly flexible beams governed by wave and Euler-Bernoulli equations, motivated by the instability of vibrating aircraft wings. It combined the derivation of physically consistent models, analysis of well-posedness via semigroup theory, boundary feedback stabilization, and structure-preserving discretization using staggered-grid finite differences.\
