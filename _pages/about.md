I am a final year (5th year) engineering student at [**EMINES School of Industrial Management**](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/), majoring in Data Science. My research interests focus on designing next-generation AI algorithms capable of reasoning. I'm particularly intrigued by the development of more efficient and intelligent AI systems, with a secondary interest in their applications to medicine, including drug discovery and medical diagnosis.  
Currently, I'm interning at [**NUS-IORA**](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Chaithanya Bandi](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/bandi-chaithanya/), where we're developing novel evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by social, economic, and voting theories, our goal is to create human-like accurate yet cost-effective assessment methods. In summer 2023, I interned at [**Africa Business School**](https://abs.um6p.ma/), supervised by [Agnèes Gorge](https://abs.um6p.ma/professors_permanent/agnes-gorge/), working on assortment optimization for major Moroccan retailers like Marjane.  


I maintain a blog where I share my insights on AI, and I actively participate in hackathons to craft innovative AI solutions. I won’t lie, I get a real thrill from winning them 😄.


### Recent news:
- 🚀 June 2024: I started my **internship** at NUS. I will be working on new ways of evaluating LLMs with [Chaithanya Bandi](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/bandi-chaithanya/).

- 🎉 April 2024: We're thrilled with the overwhelming success of the first edition of the [**Moroccan Day of Mathematics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RsTD8BXCfQ). It’s incredibly rewarding to see an event I co-founded make such a meaningful impact.  

- 🌟 March 2024: [**The Winter School**](https://midas.centrale-casablanca.net/winter-school-2024-generative-ai/index.html) featuring prominent AI researchers like Yann LeCun and Eric Xing and that I proudly coorganized took place.
- 🏅 December 2023: Thrilled to share that our medical solution, [SehhaTech](https://github.com/MoroccoAI/2023-GenAI-Hackathon/tree/main/SehhaTech), advanced to the finals of both the **IoT & AI Challenge** and the **MoroccoAI** hackathon. 
- 🏆 October 2023: I had the pleasure of participating in the [**BCG Platinion Hackathon**](https://www.bcgplatinion.com/blog/bcg-platinion-hackathon-aftermovie-2023) and winning first place. Our solution addresses a major aspect of mobility for grocery stores and also functions as a collaborative, optimized platform for emergencies. The idea was inspired by the need for better coordination in the recent earthquake relief efforts in Morocco.
