I am a final year (5th year) engineering student at [EMINES School of Industrial Management](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/), majoring in Data Science. My research interests focus on designing next-generation AI algorithms capable of reasoning. I'm particularly intrigued by the development of more efficient and intelligent AI systems, with a secondary interest in their applications to medicine, including drug discovery and medical diagnosis.  
Currently, I'm interning at [NUS-IORA](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Chaithanya Bandi](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/bandi-chaithanya/), where we're developing novel evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by social, economic, and voting theories, our goal is to create human-like accurate yet cost-effective assessment methods. In summer 2023, I interned at [Africa Business School](https://abs.um6p.ma/), supervised by [AgnÃ¨es Gorge](https://abs.um6p.ma/professors_permanent/agnes-gorge/), working on assortment optimization for major Moroccan retailers like Marjane.  


I maintain a blog where I share my insights on AI, and I actively participate in hackathons to craft innovative AI solutions. I wonâ€™t lie, I get a real thrill from winning them ðŸ˜„.


## Recent news:
-ðŸš€ June 2024: I started my internship at NUS. I will be working on new ways of evaluating LLMs with [Chaithanya Bandi](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/bandi-chaithanya/).

-ðŸŽ‰ April 2024: We're thrilled with the overwhelming success of the first edition of the Moroccan Day of Mathematics. Itâ€™s incredibly rewarding to see an event I co-founded make such a meaningful impact.
