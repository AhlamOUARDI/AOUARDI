I am a mathematics teacher, currently pursuing a PhD in applied mathematics and modeling at [**UM6P's Vanguard Center**](https://vanguard.um6p.ma/en/phd-program/). My research interest sits at the intersection of mathematics, biomedical sciences, and engineering, with a particular focus on port-Hamiltonian systems, optimal control, inverse problems, and structure-preserving modeling for complex physiological systems.

My academic journey was deepened through engineering studies at [**EMINES School of Industrial Management**](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/), where I explored diverse disciplines—from computational fluid dynamics to biomedical engineering. A formative internship at [**MAScIR**](https://www.mascir.com/) introduced me to research on tuberculosis diagnostics and wearable biosensing, igniting my interest in biology-driven applications of mathematics.

My passion for Mathematics led me to pursue an agrégation in mathematics, reinforcing my foundations in functional analysis and algebra, while also allowing me to engage in [**teaching**](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/a-propos/enseignants) at EMINES. I currently teach a course on mathematical modeling to fourth-year engineering students.

My recent collaboration include participation in the [**Final Symposium**](https://phi.uni-wuppertal.de/en/port-hamiltonian-institute/workshops/events/) of the pH course in Wuppertal.

Currently, I am seeking international collaborations, notably through visiting researcher programs.
