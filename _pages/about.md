I am a final year (5th year) engineering student at [**EMINES School of Industrial Management**](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/), minoring in Data Science. My research interests lie in the design of next-generation AI algorithms that possess advanced reasoning capabilities. I am especially fascinated by the development of more efficient and intelligent AI systems, as well as interpretability methods that enhance our understanding of large language models (LLMs).  

Currently, I am concentrating on Mechanistic Interpretability in my research intern role at **WithMartian**, an innovative startup founded in 2023. WithMartian is tackling significant challenges in AI, including interpretability and **model mapping**.

Previously, I explored novel **evaluation** frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from social, economic, and voting theories, my goal was to develop human-like, accurate, and cost-effective assessment methods.

In summer 2023, I interned at [**Africa Business School**](https://abs.um6p.ma/), supervised by [Agnès Gorge](https://abs.um6p.ma/professors_permanent/agnes-gorge/), working on assortment optimization for major Moroccan retailers like Marjane.  


I maintain **a blog on medium** where I share my insights on AI, and I actively participate in hackathons to craft innovative AI solutions. I won’t lie, I get a real thrill from winning them 😄.


### Recent news:
- 🔬 Excited to see **"Activation Space Interventions Can Be Transferred Between Large Language Models"** out! I had a great time contributing to this project and learning from the team. It explores how safety interventions can transfer across models.
- 📄 October 2024: Thrilled to share that our paper **"Adversarial Multi-Agent Evaluation of Large Language Models through Iterative Debates"** is now live on arXiv! This work, co-authored with Chaithanya Bandi, explores a novel framework for evaluating LLMs through multi-agent debates.
- 🚀 September 2024: Excited to announce that I joined [**WithMartian**](https://blog.withmartian.com/), where I am currently focusing on LLM routing technology. This promising startup, founded in 2023, is already making waves in the AI industry by delivering significant value and ranking among the top 100 AI companies.
- 🎉 April 2024: We're thrilled with the overwhelming success of the first edition of the [**Moroccan Day of Mathematics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RsTD8BXCfQ). It’s incredibly rewarding to see an event I co-founded with my friends at Math&Maroc make such a meaningful impact.  
- 🌟 March 2024: [**The Winter School**](https://midas.centrale-casablanca.net/winter-school-2024-generative-ai/index.html) featuring prominent AI researchers like Yann LeCun and Eric Xing and that I proudly coorganized took place.
- 🏅 December 2023: Thrilled to share that our medical solution, [SehhaTech](https://github.com/MoroccoAI/2023-GenAI-Hackathon/tree/main/SehhaTech), advanced to the finals of both the **IoT & AI Challenge** and the **MoroccoAI** hackathon. 
- 🏆 October 2023: I had the pleasure of participating in the [**BCG Platinion Hackathon**](https://www.bcgplatinion.com/blog/bcg-platinion-hackathon-aftermovie-2023) and winning first place. Our solution addresses a major aspect of mobility for grocery stores and also functions as a collaborative, optimized platform for emergencies. The idea was inspired by the need for better coordination in the recent earthquake relief efforts in Morocco.
